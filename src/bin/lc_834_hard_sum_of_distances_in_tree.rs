 * Testcase Example:  '6\n[[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]'
 *
 * There is an undirected connected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1
 * and n - 1 edges.
 * 
 * You are given the integer n and the array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi]
 * indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.
 * 
 * Return an array answer of length n where answer[i] is the sum of the
 * distances between the i^th node in the tree and all other nodes.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]
 * Output: [8,12,6,10,10,10]
 * Explanation: The tree is shown above.
 * We can see that dist(0,1) + dist(0,2) + dist(0,3) + dist(0,4) + dist(0,5)
 * equals 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8.
 * Hence, answer[0] = 8, and so on.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 1, edges = []
 * Output: [0]
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 2, edges = [[1,0]]
 * Output: [1,1]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^4
 * edges.length == n - 1
 * edges[i].length == 2
 * 0 <= ai, bi < n
 * ai != bi
 * The given input represents a valid tree.
