# Testcase Example:  '"babad"'
#
# Given a string s, returnÂ the longest palindromic substring in s.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: s = "babad"
# Output: "bab"
# Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: s = "cbbd"
# Output: "bb"
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: s = "a"
# Output: "a"
#
#
# Example 4:
#
#
# Input: s = "ac"
# Output: "a"
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= s.length <= 1000
# s consist of only digits and English letters.
