# Testcase Example:  '[3,4,5,1,2]'
#
# Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1
# and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might
# become:
#
#
# [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
# [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
#
#
# Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results
# in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].
#
# Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum
# element of this array.
#
# You must write an algorithm that runs inÂ O(log n) time.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4
# times.
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
# Output: 11
# Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4
# times.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# n == nums.length
# 1 <= n <= 5000
# -5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
# All the integers of nums are unique.
# nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.

            Note: key argument is added since 3.10

            Locate the insertion point for x in a to maintain sorted order. The
            parameters lo and hi may be used to specify a subset of the list
            which should be considered; by default the entire list is used. If x
            is already present in a, the insertion point will be before (to the
                    left of) any existing entries. The return value is suitable for use as the first parameter to list.insert() assuming that a is
            already sorted.

            The returned insertion point i partitions the array a into two
            halves so that all(val <= x for val in a[lo : i]) for the left side
            and all(val > x for val in a[i : hi]) for the right side."""
