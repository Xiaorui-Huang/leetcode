# Testcase Example:  '4\n[[0,1],[0,2],[1,2]]'
#
# There are n computers numbered from 0 to n - 1 connected by ethernet cables
# connections forming a network where connections[i] = [ai, bi] represents a
# connection between computers ai and bi. Any computer can reach any other
# computer directly or indirectly through the network.
#
# You are given an initial computer network connections. You can extract
# certain cables between two directly connected computers, and place them
# between any pair of disconnected computers to make them directly connected.
#
# Return the minimum number of times you need to do this in order to make all
# the computers connected. If it is not possible, return -1.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2]]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: Remove cable between computer 1 and 2 and place between
# computers 1 and 3.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]
# Output: 2
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,2]]
# Output: -1
# Explanation: There are not enough cables.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= n <= 10^5
# 1 <= connections.length <= min(n * (n - 1) / 2, 10^5)
# connections[i].length == 2
# 0 <= ai, bi < n
# ai != bi
# There are no repeated connections.
# No two computers are connected by more than one cable.
#
