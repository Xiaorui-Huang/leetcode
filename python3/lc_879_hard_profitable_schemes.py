# Testcase Example:  '5\n3\n[2,2]\n[2,3]'
#
# There is a group of n members, and a list of various crimes they could
# commit. The i^th crime generates a profit[i] and requires group[i] members to
# participate in it. If a member participates in one crime, that member can't
# participate in another crime.
#
# Let's call a profitable scheme any subset of these crimes that generates at
# least minProfit profit, and the total number of members participating in that
# subset of crimes is at most n.
#
# Return the number of schemes that can be chosen. Since the answer may be very
# large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: n = 5, minProfit = 3, group = [2,2], profit = [2,3]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: To make a profit of at least 3, the group could either commit
# crimes 0 and 1, or just crime 1.
# In total, there are 2 schemes.
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: n = 10, minProfit = 5, group = [2,3,5], profit = [6,7,8]
# Output: 7
# Explanation: To make a profit of at least 5, the group could commit any
# crimes, as long as they commit one.
# There are 7 possible schemes: (0), (1), (2), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), and
# (0,1,2).
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= n <= 100
# 0 <= minProfit <= 100
# 1 <= group.length <= 100
# 1 <= group[i] <= 100
# profit.length == group.length
# 0 <= profit[i] <= 100

"""
Suppose we have taken some crimes from range 0 â‰¤ j < i , used m
members to execute them, and made a profit of p from them. We used m
members, so n - m are left for future crimes. As we have made a profit of
p already, we need to make at least minProfit - p more
from future crimes. So now,

n = n - m
minProfit = minProfit - p
Let's denote this by f(i , n, minProfit)
