#
# Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if
# they are the same or not.
#
# Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical,
# and the nodes have the same value.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
# Output: true
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
# Output: false
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
# Output: false
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
# -10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4
#
#
