# Testcase Example:  '[8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]'
#
# Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum value v for which there
# exist different nodes a and b where v = |a.val - b.val| and a is an ancestor
# of b.
#
# A node a is an ancestor of b if either: any child of a is equal to bÂ or any
# child of a is an ancestor of b.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: root = [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]
# Output: 7
# Explanation: We have various ancestor-node differences, some of which are
# given below :
# |8 - 3| = 5
# |3 - 7| = 4
# |8 - 1| = 7
# |10 - 13| = 3
# Among all possible differences, the maximum value of 7 is obtained by |8 - 1|
# = 7.
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: root = [1,null,2,null,0,3]
# Output: 3
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 5000].
# 0 <= Node.val <= 10^5
#
