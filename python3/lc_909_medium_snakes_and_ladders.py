# Testcase Example:  '[[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,35,-1,-1,13,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,15,-1,-1,-1,-1]]'
#
# You are given an n x n integer matrix board where the cells are labeled from
# 1 to n^2 in a Boustrophedon style starting from the bottom left of the board
# (i.e. board[n - 1][0]) and alternating direction each row.
#
# You start on square 1 of the board. In each move, starting from square curr,
# do the following:
#
#
# Choose a destination square next with a label in the range [curr + 1,
# min(curr + 6, n^2)].
#
#
# This choice simulates the result of a standard 6-sided die roll: i.e., there
# are always at most 6 destinations, regardless of the size of the
# board.
#
#
# If next has a snake or ladder, you must move to the destination of that snake
# or ladder. Otherwise, you move to next.
# The game ends when you reach the square n^2.
#
#
# A board square on row r and column c has a snake or ladder if board[r][c] !=
# -1. The destination of that snake or ladder is board[r][c]. Squares 1 and n^2
# do not have a snake or ladder.
#
# Note that you only take a snake or ladder at most once per move. If the
# destination to a snake or ladder is the start of another snake or ladder, you
# do not follow the subsequentÂ snake or ladder.
#
#
# For example, suppose the board is [[-1,4],[-1,3]], and on the first move,
# your destination square is 2. You follow the ladder to square 3, but do not
# follow the subsequent ladder to 4.
#
#
# Return the least number of moves required to reach the square n^2. If it is
# not possible to reach the square, return -1.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: board =
# [[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,35,-1,-1,13,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,15,-1,-1,-1,-1]]
# Output: 4
# Explanation:
# In the beginning, you start at square 1 (at row 5, column 0).
# You decide to move to square 2 and must take the ladder to square 15.
# You then decide to move to square 17 and must take the snake to square 13.
# You then decide to move to square 14 and must take the ladder to square 35.
# You then decide to move to square 36, ending the game.
# This is the lowest possible number of moves to reach the last square, so
# return 4.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: board = [[-1,-1],[-1,3]]
# Output: 1
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# n == board.length == board[i].length
# 2 <= n <= 20
# grid[i][j] is either -1 or in the range [1, n^2].
# The squares labeled 1 and n^2 do not have any ladders or snakes.

    We run BFS on a graph whose vertices are the board cells, and the edges are
    moves between them. There are n2n^2n 2 vertices and no more than 6n^2=O(n^2)
    edges. The time complexity of BFS is O(|V| + |E|),

    where |V| is the number of vertices and |E| is the number of
    edges. We have |V|=n^2 and |E| < 6 n^2 , thus
    the total time complexity for BFS is O(7n^2) = O(n^2)

    We also spend some time associating each (row, col) with a label, but this
    also costs.

    Space-wise we take n^2 space for visited array"""
