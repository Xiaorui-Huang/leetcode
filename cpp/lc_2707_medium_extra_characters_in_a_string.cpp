 * Testcase Example:  '"leetscode"\n["leet","code","leetcode"]'
 *
 * You are given a 0-indexed string s and a dictionary of words dictionary. You
 * have to break s into one or more non-overlapping substrings such that each
 * substring is present in dictionary. There may be some extra characters in s
 * which are not present in any of the substrings.
 * 
 * Return the minimum number of extra characters left over if you break up s
 * optimally.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "leetscode", dictionary = ["leet","code","leetcode"]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: We can break s in two substrings: "leet" from index 0 to 3 and
 * "code" from index 5 to 8. There is only 1 unused character (at index 4), so
 * we return 1.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "sayhelloworld", dictionary = ["hello","world"]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: We can break s in two substrings: "hello" from index 3 to 7 and
 * "world" from index 8 to 12. The characters at indices 0, 1, 2 are not used
 * in any substring and thus are considered as extra characters. Hence, we
 * return 3.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= s.length <= 50
 * 1 <= dictionary.length <= 50
 * 1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 50
 * dictionary[i]Â and s consists of only lowercase English letters
 * dictionary contains distinct words
